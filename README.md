# UniteMe

We shall build a platform where people can search for their families and friends who got separated due to unfortunate natural disasters.

So whenever and wherever someone raises the voice ‘UniteMe’, our platform is there to help.

People who are searching for someone will search for them in the existing database. 
If they find the person that’s a great success.
If not they can create a entry for the person.
People can also search for themselves to see if someone is finding them.


People/NGO's can also post/click the photos of people.
And people can search for there family and friends by uploading a photograph.
The two photographs are matched by Microsoft's Face API.

That's 'UniteMe'! :)
